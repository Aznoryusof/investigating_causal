# Investigating Causal Relationships
This repository investigates the different modern approaches available to uncover causal factors behind employees' staying intentions within an organisation, provided as Jupyter Notebooks.

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to study in detail the various statistical methods and APIs available on identifying causal relationships, and serves as a quickstart guide to anyone trying to better understand how to apply these methods on their dataset.

### Methods Used
1) Structural Equation Modelling [Link to Jupyter notebook]
2) Bayesian Networks [Link to Jupyter notebook]

## Project Description
The data that would be used for this task is based on a survey of employees’ attitudes and perception towards their workplace. The questionnaire items included questions which attempts to represent the following latent constructs: 
1) Organisational Commitment
2) Staying Intentions
3) Attitudes Towards Co-Workers
3) Environmental Perceptions
4) Job Satisfaction

The main objective is to build a suitable model to predict the influences of the different factors on employees’ staying intentions.
